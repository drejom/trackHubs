<b>Ensemble Diversity Value (EDV)</b>

Andrews et al 2020: RNAfold partition function calculations are utilized to characterize the potential structural diversity of the native sequence. These include the ensemble diversity (ED) and the centroid structure. The centroid structure depicts the base pairs which were “most common” (i.e. had the minimal base pair distance) between all the Boltzmann-ensemble conformations predicted for the native sequence. The ED then attempts to quantify the variety of different structures which were present in the ensemble (where higher numbers indicate multiple structures unique from the predicted MFE and low numbers indicate the presence of a dominant MFE structure highly represented in the ensemble).

<H2>Interpretation</H2>
<P>
Light shades indicate windows dominated by few stable structures for a window, darker shades lack stable structures.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Andrews et al downloaded the SARS-CoV-2 genome and ran ScanFold-Scan with a 120bp window across the genome. Each window was fed to RNAfold from the Vienna package. The output of these algorithms was used to calculate a change in the minimum free energy for each window, a z-score and an associated p-value. RNAfold was used to estimate the potential structural diversity within windows, summarised as a score for the ensemble of probable structures for each.
